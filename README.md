# 🧑‍💻 Day 1: Semantic HTML Profile Page

Welcome to Day 1 of my 30-Day Front-End Developer Sprint! This project kicks off the challenge with a simple but meaningful milestone: building a personal profile page using semantic HTML.

## 🚀 What I Built

A clean, accessible profile page that includes:
- My name and a short bio
- A profile image
- Contact links (email, GitHub, LinkedIn)
- Semantic HTML structure using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to use semantic HTML tags to improve structure and accessibility
- How to preview changes instantly using Live Server in VS Code
- How to initialize Git and push code to GitHub (with a few bumps along the way 😅)
