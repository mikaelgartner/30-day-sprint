# 🧑‍💻 Day 1: Semantic HTML Profile Page

Welcome to Day 1 of my 30-Day Front-End Developer Sprint! This project kicks off the challenge with a simple but meaningful milestone: building a personal profile page using semantic HTML.

## 🚀 What I Built

A clean, accessible profile page that includes:
- My name and a short bio
- A profile image
- Contact links (email, GitHub, LinkedIn)
- Semantic HTML structure using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to use semantic HTML tags to improve structure and accessibility
- How to preview changes instantly using Live Server in VS Code
- How to initialize Git and push code to GitHub (with a few bumps along the way 😅)

# 🎨 Day 2: Profile Page with CSS Styling

This is my Day 2 project from the 30-Day Front-End Developer Sprint. I built a personal profile page using semantic HTML and styled it with external CSS.

## ✅ Features

- Custom fonts for headings and paragraphs
- Styled images with rounded corners and shadows
- Link hover effects with smooth transitions
- Bullet-free lists and centered navigation
- CSS variables for theme colors

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` — HTML structure of the profile page
- `style.css` — External stylesheet with all styling rules

## 🚀 Live Preview

Coming soon — stay tuned!

## 🛠️ What I Learned

- How to link external CSS
- How to use CSS variables for cleaner styling
- How to style text, images, and links
- How to push changes to GitHub using Git

Next up: **Day 3 — Flexbox Layouts!**

🟥 Day 3: Layouts — Flexbox & Git Mastery
Today’s Wins:
- 🎨 Built a responsive card layout using Flexbox
- 🖼️ Styled cards with gradients, shadows, and hover effects
- 📱 Added media queries for mobile responsiveness
- 🔀 Resolved a Git merge conflict between main and master
- 🧹 Cleaned up duplicate assets and organized image files
- 🚀 Successfully pushed Day 3 work to the main branch on GitHub
- ✅ Verified layout integrity and responsiveness in browser

Reflection:
Today wasn’t just about layout — it was a deep dive into real-world Git challenges. I learned how to merge branches, resolve conflicts, and keep my repo clean. The card layout now looks sharp and adapts beautifully across screen sizes. 

Feeling proud and ready for Day 4!
