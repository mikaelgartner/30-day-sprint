# 🟧 Day 8: Arrays & Loops — To-Do List App

Today I dove deep into JavaScript arrays and loop logic. I learned how to manipulate arrays using methods like `.push()`, `.splice()`, `.flat()`, `.flatMap()`, `.reduce()`, and `.reduceRight()`, and explored how loops like `forEach()` help dynamically render content in the DOM.

### ✅ Key Concepts Learned
- How to flatten arrays and why it's useful
- Difference between `.splice()` and `.toSpliced()` (mutable vs immutable)
- How `.flatMap()` combines mapping and flattening in one step
- How `.reduce()` and `.reduceRight()` process arrays in different directions
- How to use `forEach()` to loop through tasks and update the UI

### 🛠️ Project Built: To-Do List App
- Built a fully functional to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Tasks are stored as objects with `text` and `done` properties
- Users can add tasks, mark them as complete with checkboxes, and remove them
- Used `forEach()` to render tasks dynamically in the DOM
- Styled the app with a clean layout and responsive design

### 🎨 Features Implemented
- Input field and “Add Task” button
- Checkbox to toggle task completion
- “Remove” button for each task
- Visual feedback for completed tasks (line-through)
- Responsive layout with Flexbox and modern styling

### 🧠 Console Practice
- Tested array methods and loop logic directly in the browser console
- Practiced manipulating task arrays and observing DOM updates
