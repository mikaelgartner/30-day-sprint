# 🟧 **Day 14 Summary: Mission Generator & Modular Thinking**

---

### 🎯 **Core Achievements**
- ✅ Built a **Cyberpunk Mission Terminal** with dynamic difficulty selection
- ✅ Implemented **radio buttons** for Easy, Medium, and Hard tiers
- ✅ Styled the UI with glowing neon effects and terminal aesthetics
- ✅ Refactored JavaScript to use **modular, scalable logic**
- ✅ Debugged object access using `missions[difficulty]` — now fully understood
- ✅ Explored how to pass dynamic data into functions for flexible reuse

### 🧠 **Key Learnings**
- 📦 **Object Access**  
  Learned how to use bracket notation (`object[key]`) to dynamically access properties

- 🔁 **Function Parameters**  
  Refactored `missionGenerator()` to accept mission arrays and difficulty labels

- 🧩 **Modular Design**  
  Began thinking in reusable components — a foundational skill for game systems

- 🧠 **Debugging Mindset**  
  Identified and corrected logic errors by asking the right questions

### 🕹️ **Game Component Tag**
- 🟣 Game Component: Quest generator UI and mission logic

This module is now game-ready and could evolve into:
- A **quest board** with mission history  
- A **difficulty selector panel**  
- A **persistent mission log** using localStorage  
- A **reward system** or branching quest tree
