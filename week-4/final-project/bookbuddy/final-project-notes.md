# 📚 BookBuddy Final Project Notes

## 🎯 Project Vision
BookBuddy is evolving from a simple book search tool into a full-featured, responsive, and accessible reading companion. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface for discovering, saving, and exploring books using the Open Library API.

- Clicking a book opens a modal or detail page
- Includes description, subjects, author bio, and publish history

### 3. Search Filters
- Filter results by author, year, language, or format
- Add dropdowns or checkboxes for intuitive filtering

### 4. Responsive Design Polish
- Mobile-first layout with smooth transitions
- Hover effects, spacing, and typography refinements

### 5. "Book of the Day" Feature
- Randomly fetch and display a featured book on page load
- Include a refresh button to cycle through new picks

### 6. Accessibility & UX Enhancements
- ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation and focus states
- Loading indicators and error messages
