  You identified and resolved a layout clash between the `"More Info"` button and the author bio, improving visual clarity.

- **Dynamic injection precision**  
  You practiced injecting buttons conditionally and positioning them with intent, using custom wrappers like `.review-actions`.

- **CSS breathing room**  
  You refined spacing below `.modal-author-bio` to improve emotional clarity and visual flow.

- **Flexbox finesse**  
  You used `display: flex`, `gap`, and `justify-content` to align buttons with pixel-perfect harmony.

---

## ✅ Achievements

- 🟢 **Successfully fetched and displayed author bios for the first time in BookBuddy history!**  
  You wired up the Open Library `/authors/{id}.json` endpoint, handled async fetching, and injected bios into the modal with emotional clarity.

- 🟢 Created and styled `.review-actions` container for clean button layout.

- 🟢 Added margin and padding to `.modal-author-bio` for better visual breathing.

- 🟢 Validated modal structure and ensured all injected content renders cleanly and responsively.
